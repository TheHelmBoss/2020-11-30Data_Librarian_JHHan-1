At these redshifts, the H$\\alpha$ line shifts to the $K_s$-band. By\r\ncomparing $K_s$-band photometry to underlying stellar population model fits\r\nto other UV, optical, and near-infrared data, we infer the H$\\alpha$ flux for\r\neach galaxy. We obtain the best agreement between H$\\alpha$- and UV-based SFRs\r\nif we assume that the ionized gas and stellar continuum are reddened by the\r\nsame value and that the Calzetti attenuation curve is applied to both. Aided\r\nwith MIPS 24$\\mu$m data, we find that an attenuation curve steeper than the\r\nCalzetti curve is needed to reproduce the observed IR/UV ratios of galaxies\r\nyounger than 100 Myr. Furthermore, using the bolometric star-formation rate\r\ninferred from the UV and mid-IR data (SFR$_IR$+SFR$_UV$), we calculated the\r\nconversion between the H$\\alpha$ luminosity and SFR to be $(7.5\\pm1.3) \\times\r\n10^-42$ for a Salpeter IMF, which is consistent with the Kennicutt (1998)\r\nconversion. The derived conversion factor is independent of any assumption of\r\nthe dust correction and is robust to stellar population model uncertainties.",

        "abstract": "To compute the SFR of galaxies from the rest-frame UV it is essential to take\r\ninto account the obscuration by dust. To do so, one of the most popular methods\r\nconsists in combining the UV with the emission from the dust itself in the IR.\r\nYet, different studies have derived different estimators, showing that no such\r\nhybrid estimator is truly universal. In this paper we aim at understanding and\r\nquantifying what physical processes drive the variations between different\r\nhybrid estimators. Doing so, we aim at deriving new universal UV+IR hybrid\r\nestimators to correct the UV for dust attenuation, taking into account the\r\nintrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We use the CIGALE code to model the\r\nspatially-resolved FUV to FIR SED of eight nearby star-forming galaxies drawn\r\nfrom the KINGFISH sample. This allows us to determine their local physical\r\nproperties, and in particular their UV attenuation, average SFR, average\r\nspecific SFR (sSFR), and their stellar mass. We then examine how hybrid\r\nestimators depend on said properties. We find that hybrid UV+IR estimators\r\nstrongly depend on the stellar mass surface density (in particular at 70 and\r\n100 micron) and on the sSFR (in particular at 24 micron and the TIR).\r\nConsequently, the IR scaling coefficients for UV obscuration can vary by almost\r\nan order of magnitude. This result contrasts with other groups who found\r\nrelatively constant coefficients with small deviations. We exploit these\r\nvariations to construct a new class of hybrid estimators based on observed UV\r\nto near-IR colours and near-IR luminosity densities per unit area. We find that\r\nthey can reliably be extended to entire galaxies. The new estimators provide\r\nbetter estimates of attenuation-corrected UV emission than classical hybrid\r\nestimators. Naturally taking into account the variable impact of dust heated by\r\nold stellar populations, they constitute a step towards universal estimators.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates based on four IR sensor automatic control of railway gate using a microcontroller system. There are so many railway accidents happening due to the carelessness in manual operations or lack of worker. So  this paper describes four IR sensor based automatic control of railway gate system for saving precious human lives and preventing major disasters in railway track. Railway gate may be saved for the road users to prevent accidents in terms of train speed at a level crossing. Automatic railway gate control system is an innovative circuit which automatically controls the operation of railway gates detecting the arrival and departure of train at the gate. This automatic system can be replaced by the gates operated by the gatekeeper. The operation using Arduino UNO that integrated with other circuits involved such as power supply  IR sensors  light indicators  buzzer  and gate motors. The servo motor is used to control the open and close status of the railway crossing gate. The four IR sensors are placed on the railway tracks. The gate is closed when the first one senses the train and is opened when the second one senses the train. This operation is performed when the train is coming from the left side of the gate. When the train is coming from the right side  the third and fourth sensors is performed in the same operation. The red LED is HIGH when the gate is closed and the green LED is HIGH when the gate is opened. This system is based on software programming to operate the hardware structure. Program for four IR sensor based automatic control of railway gate system is based on Arduino UNO with C language. The main function of the design is Arduino UNO.

        "abstract": "Queries and click-through data taken from search engine transaction logs is an attractive alternative to traditional test collections, due to its volume and the direct relation to end-user querying. The overall aim of this paper is to answer the question: How does click-through data differ from explicit human relevance judgments in information retrieval evaluation? We compare a traditional test collection with manual judgments to transaction log based test collections---by using queries as topics and subsequent clicks as pseudo-relevance judgments for the clicked results.</p> <p>Specifically, we investigate the following two research questions: Firstly, are there significant differences between clicks and relevance judgments. Earlier research suggests that although clicks and explicit judgments show reasonable agreement, clicks are different from static absolute relevance judgments. Secondly, are there significant differences between system ranking based on clicks and based on relevance judgments? This is an open question, but earlier research suggests that comparative evaluation in terms of system ranking is remarkably robust.",

        "abstract": "IR research has a strong tradition of laboratory evaluation of systems. Such research is based on test collections, pre-defined\r\ntest topics, and standard evaluation metrics. While recent research has emphasized the user viewpoint by proposing user-basedmetrics and non-binary relevance assessments, the methods are insufficient for truly user-based evaluation. The common assumptionof a single query per topic and session poorly represents real life. On the other hand, one well-known metric for multiplequeries per session, instance recall, does not capture early (within session) retrieval of (highly) relevant documents. Wepropose an extension to the Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) metric, the Session-based DCG (sDCG) metric for evaluation scenariosinvolving multiple query sessions, graded relevance assessments, and open-ended user effort including decisions to stop searching.The sDCG metric discounts relevant results from later queries within a session. We exemplify the sDCG metric with data froman interactive experiment, we discuss how the metric might be applied, and we present research questions for which the metricis helpful.",

        "abstract": "As an extension to the current Web, Semantic Web will not only contain structured data with machine understandable semantics but also textual information. While structured queries can be used to find information more precisely on the Semantic Web, keyword searches are still needed to help exploit textual information. It thus becomes very important that we can combine precise structured queries with imprecise keyword searches to have a hybrid query capability. In addition, due to the huge volume of information on the Semantic Web, the hybrid query must be processed in a very scalable way. In this paper, we define such a hybrid query capability that combines unary tree-shaped structured queries with keyword searches. We show how existing information retrieval (IR) index structures and functions can be reused to index semantic web data and its textual information, and how the hybrid query is evaluated on the index structure using IR engines in an efficient and scalable manner. We implemented this IR approach in an engine called Semplore. Comprehensive experiments on its performance show that it is a promising approach. It leads us to believe that it may be possible to evolve current web search engines to query and search the Semantic Web. Finally, we breifly describe how Semplore is used for searching Wikipedia and an IBM customer\u2019s product information.",

The AlIr and Al2.7Ir phases had the widest composition ranges: 47-53 and 23-30 at.% Ir respectively.\r\nMechanical tests, in the form of Vickers hardness tests were used to deduce the fracture toughness of the alloys.

        "abstract": "Nowadays we use information retrieval systems and services as part of our many day-to-day activities ranging from a web and database search to searching for various digital libraries, audio and video collections/services, and so on. However, IR systems and services make extensive use of ICT (information and communication technologies) and increasing use of ICT can significantly increase greenhouse gas (GHG, a term used to denote emission of harmful gases in the atmosphere) emissions. Sustainable development, and more importantly environmental sustainability, has become a major area of concern of various national and international bodies and as a result various initiatives and measures are being proposed for reducing the environmental impact of industries, businesses, governments and institutions. Research also shows that appropriate use of ICT can reduce the overall GHG emissions of a business, product or service. Green IT and cloud computing can play a key role in reducing the environmental impact of ICT. This paper proposes the concept of Green IR systems and services that can play a key role in reducing the overall environmental impact of various ICT-based services in education and research, business, government, etc., that are increasingly being reliant on access and use of digital information. However, to date there has not been any systematic research towards building Green IR systems and services. This paper points out the major challenges in building Green IR systems and services, and two different methods are proposed for estimating the energy consumption, and the corresponding GHG emissions, of an IR system or service. This paper also proposes the four key enablers of a Green IR viz. Standardize, Share, Reuse and Green behavior. Further research required to achieve these for building Green IR systems and services are also mentioned.",

        "abstract": "Context influences the search process, but to date research has not definitively identified which aspects of context are the most influential for information retrieval, and thus are worthy of integration in today's retrieval systems. In this research, we isolated for examination two aspects of context: task and document genre and examined the relationship between them within a software engineering work domain. In this domain, the nature of the task has an impact on decisions of relevance and usefulness, and the document collection contains a distinctive set of genre. Our data set was a document repository created and used by our target population. The document surrogates were meta-tagged by purpose and document type. Correspondence analysis of this categorical data identified some specific relationships between genres and tasks, as well as four broad dimensions of variability underlying these relationships. These results have the potential to inform the design of a contextual retrieval system by refining search results for this domain.",

        "abstract": "We present radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of radiatively-driven gas\r\nshells launched by bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) in isolated dark matter\r\nhaloes. Our goals are (1) to investigate the ability of AGN radiation pressure\r\non dust to launch galactic outflows and (2) to constrain the efficiency of\r\ninfrared (IR) multi-scattering in boosting outflow acceleration. Our\r\nsimulations are performed with the radiation-hydrodynamic code RAMSES-RT and\r\ninclude both single- and multi-scattered radiation pressure from an AGN,\r\nradiative cooling and self-gravity. Since outflowing shells always eventually\r\nbecome transparent to the incident radiation field, outflows that sweep up all\r\nintervening gas are likely to remain gravitationally bound to their halo even\r\nat high AGN luminosities. The expansion of outflowing shells is well described\r\nby simple analytic models as long as the shells are mildly optically thick to\r\nIR radiation. In this case, an enhancement in the acceleration of shells\r\nthrough IR multi-scattering occurs as predicted, i.e. a force dP/dt = tau_IR\r\nL/c is exerted on the gas. For high optical depths tau_IR > 50, however,\r\nmomentum transfer between outflowing optically thick gas and IR radiation is\r\nrapidly suppressed, even if the radiation is efficiently confined. At high\r\ntau_IR, the characteristic flow time becomes shorter than the required trapping\r\ntime of IR radiation such that the momentum flux dP/dt << tau_IR L/c. We argue\r\nthat while unlikely to unbind massive galactic gaseous haloes, AGN radiation\r\npressure on dust could play an important role in regulating star formation and\r\nblack hole accretion in the nuclei of massive compact galaxies at high\r\nredshift.",

Among the six intermetallic compounds in this system, the formation enthalpies of Al9Ir2, Al3Ir and AlIr were obtained from T\u00a0=\u00a00\u00a0K first-principles total energy calculations. The formation enthalpies of Al45Ir13, Al13Ir4 and Al2.7Ir, whose structures are either unknown or too complicated for first-principles calculations, were estimated using a greedy algorithm developed in this study. The mixing enthalpies of Al1-xIrx face-centered cubic (fcc) alloys were calculated at x\u00a0=\u00a00.25, 0.5 and 0.75 using the special quasirandom structure approach. The vibrational formation entropy of AlIr was also calculated using the supercell method within the harmonic and quasi-harmonic approximation, respectively. We demonstrated that, with the incorporation of first-principles energetics, a physically meaningful thermodynamic description of the Al-Ir system can be obtained even with very scarce experimental data. The predicted B2 and fcc two-phase equilibrium in the Al-Ir-Ni ternary system was also in reasonable agreement with experiments.",

        "abstract": "Introduction. Deeper knowledge of physicians' eHealth-related behaviour is needed in different countries. This paper clarifies the usage patterns of eHealth services among European general practitioners.\nMethod. The survey database Flash-Eurobarometer No. 126 'General Practitioners and the Internet' is analysed. Additional socio-demographic variables are also included, such as country, age, sex, location, and size of the medical practice. Telephone interviews were conducted for data collection purposes.\nAnalysis. Latent class cluster analysis was applied to identify homogeneous segments of eHealth adopters among European physicians. Country, age, sex, location, and size of the medical practice were included as covariates in the analyses, in order to obtain a descriptive profiling of the identified segments.\nResults. The analysis yielded three segments of European physicians using eHealth services. After adding the group of physicians not using the Internet, the following four final segments were identified: Information Searchers, Advanced Users, Laggards and Non-Internet Users. The analysis of covariates in the latent class cluster model showed that country, sex and age were significantly related to physicians' usage patterns of eHealth services. Chi squared analyses were performed to account for the group of Non-Internet Users, further confirming the existence of strong country differences and moderate age influences, but very weak effects of sex on physicians' eHealth-related behaviour.\nConclusion. The identification of European physicians' eHealth usage patterns contributes to the development of suitable and adapted promotion strategies, aimed at ensuring efficient adoption processes of Internet technologies among providers of patient care services in the analysed countries.",

Using forced-photometry\r\non public WISE data at the locations of SDSS point sources, we incorporate this\r\nall-sky data into the training of the XDQSOz models originally developed to\r\nselect quasars from optical photometry. The combination of WISE and SDSS\r\ninformation is far more powerful than SDSS alone, particularly at $z>2$. The\r\nuse of SDSS$+$WISE photometry is comparable to the use of\r\nSDSS$+$ultraviolet$+$near-IR data. We release a new public catalogue of\r\n5,537,436 (total; 3,874,639 weighted by probability) potential quasars with\r\nprobability $P_QSO > 0.2$. The catalogue includes redshift\r\nprobabilities for all objects. We also release an updated version of the\r\npublicly available set of codes to calculate quasar and redshift probabilities\r\nfor various combinations of data. Finally, we demonstrate that this method of\r\nselecting quasars using WISE data is both more complete and efficient than\r\nsimple WISE color-cuts, especially at high redshift. Our fits verify that above\r\n$z 3$ WISE colors become bluer than the standard cuts applied to select\r\nquasars. Currently, the analysis is limited to quasars with optical\r\ncounterparts, and thus cannot be used to find highly obscured quasars that WISE\r\ncolor-cuts identify in significant numbers.",

The results are compared with the corresponding data calculated at the conventional ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) level using the same basis set and with available experimental data. Calculations show that (a) three amino tautomers are slightly nonplanar species with, evidently, a distorted amino group, (b) the DFT (B3-LYP)/G-31G(d, p) method predicts better molecular parameters, than do the HF calculations, and (c) the DFT(B3-LYP)-calculated vibrational IR spectra of isocytosine agree well with the available recorded IR spectra, and they show marked improvement over the IR spectra predicted at the HF/6-31G(d, p) level. Tautomeric stabilities of isocytosine are discussed on the basis of computed electronic energies by the DFT(B3-LYP) and ab initio approaches including the MP2 and MP4(SDQ) calculations of electronic energies and predicted zero-point vibrational energies by DFT(B3-LYP) and HF methods. This relative energies at 0 K of the tautomeric forms of isocytosine predicted by both conventional ab initio and DET(B3-LYP) methods correlate well with the experimental data, showing the predominance of the aminohydroxy tautomer of isocytosine for an isolated molecule.

        "abstract": "We present a novel measure for ranking evaluation, called Twist (\u03c4). It is a measure for informational intents, which handles both binary and graded relevance. \u03c4 stems from the observation that searching is currently a that searching is currently taken for granted and it is natural for users to assume that search engines are available and work well. As a consequence, users may assume the utility they have in finding relevant documents, which is the focus of traditional measures, as granted. On the contrary, they may feel uneasy when the system returns nonrelevant documents because they are then forced to do additional work to get the desired information, and this causes avoidable effort. The latter is the focus of \u03c4, which evaluates the effectiveness of a system from the point of view of the effort required to the users to retrieve the desired information. We provide a formal definition of \u03c4, a demonstration of its properties, and introduce the notion of effort/gain plots, which complement traditional utility-based measures. By means of an extensive experimental evaluation, \u03c4 is shown to grasp different aspects of system performances, to not require extensive and costly assessments, and to be a robust tool for detecting differences between systems.",

        "abstract": "We present cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, performed with\r\nthe code Ramses-RT, of radiatively-driven outflows in a massive quasar host\r\nhalo at z = 6. Our simulations include both single- and multi-scattered\r\nradiation pressure on dust from a quasar and are compared against simulations\r\nperformed with thermal feedback. For radiation pressure-driving, we show that\r\nthere is a critical quasar luminosity above which a galactic outflow is\r\nlaunched, set by the equilibrium of gravitational and radiation forces. While\r\nthis critical luminosity is unrealistically high in the single-scattering limit\r\nfor plausible black hole masses, it is in line with a 3 x 10^9 M_SUN black hole\r\naccreting at its Eddington limit, if infrared (IR) multi-scattering radiation\r\npressure is included. The outflows are fast (v > 1000 km/s) and strongly\r\nmass-loaded with peak mass outflow rates 10^3 - 10^4 M_SUN/yr, but short-lived\r\n(< 10 Myr). Outflowing material is multi-phase, though predominantly composed\r\nof cool gas, forming via a thermal instability in the shocked swept-up\r\ncomponent. Radiation pressure- and thermally-driven outflows both affect their\r\nhost galaxies profoundly, but in different, complementary ways.\r\nThermally-driven outflows couple more efficiently to diffuse halo gas,\r\ngenerating more powerful, hotter and more volume-filling outflows. IR\r\nradiation, through its ability to penetrate dense gas via diffusion, is more\r\nefficient at ejecting gas from the bulge. The combination of gas ejection\r\nthrough outflows with internal pressurisation by trapped IR radiation leads to\r\na complete shut down of star formation in the bulge. We hence argue that\r\nradiation pressure-driven feedback may be a crucial ingredient in regulating\r\nstar formation in compact starbursts, especially during the quasar's\r\n\u00f6bscured\"' phase.",

It claims that contemporary feminist perspectives on international relations are based on ontologies and epistemologies that are quite different from those that inform the conventional discipline. Therefore, they do not fit comfortably within conventional state-centric and structural approaches to IR theorizing, nor with the methodologies usually employed by IR scholars. As an illustration of how these differences can cause misunderstandings, the article offers some feminist perspectives on security, a concept central to the discipline. It also suggests how feminist approaches can offer some new ways to understand contemporary security problems. In conclusion, it suggests how feminist/IR engagements might be pursued more constructively.",

The literature on relevance reveals how the relevance concept, especially in regard to the \r\nmultidimensionality of relevance, is many faceted, and does not just refer to the various relevance criteria users may apply in the process of judging relevance of retrieved information objects. From our point of view, the multidimensionality of relevance explains why some will argue that no \r\nconsensus has been reached on the relevance concept. Thus, the objective of this article is to present an overview of the many different views and ways by which the concept of relevance is used\u2014leading to a consistent and compatible understanding of the concept. In addition, special attention \r\nis paid to the type of situational relevance. Many researchers perceive situational relevance as the most realistic type of user relevance, and therefore situational relevance is discussed with reference to its potential dynamic nature, and as a requirement for interactive information retrieval \r\n(IIR) evaluation.",

The main advantage of this approach is to efficiently reduce the dimension of the active space generated into the configuration interaction (CI) process. Here, we assume that the Hamiltonian writes as a sum of products of operators. This adaptive algorithm was developed with the use of three correlated conditions, i.e., a suitable starting space, a criterion for convergence, and a procedure to expand the approximate space. The velocity of the algorithm was increased with the use of a posteriori error estimator (residue) to select the most relevant direction to increase the space. Two examples have been selected for benchmark. In the case of H2CO, we mainly study the performance of A-VCI algorithm: comparison with the variation-perturbation method, choice of the initial space, and residual contributions. For CH3CN, we compare the A-VCI results with a computed reference spectrum using the same potential energy surface and for an active space reduced by about 90%.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the paper is to amalgamate theories of text retrieval from various research traditions into a cognitive theory for information retrieval interaction. Set in a cognitive framework, the paper outlines the concept of polyrepresentation applied to both the user's cognitive space and the information space of IR systems. The concept seeks to represent the current user's information need, problem state, and domain work task or interest in a structure of causality. Further, it implies that we should apply different methods of representation and a variety of IR techniques of different cognitive and functional origin simultaneously to each semantic full-text entity in the information space. The cognitive differences imply that by applying cognitive overlaps of information objects, originating from different interpretations of such objects through time and by type, the degree of uncertainty inherent in IR is decreased. Polyrepresentation and the use of cognitive overlaps are associated with, but not identical to, data fusion in IR. By explicitly incorporating all the cognitive structures participating in the interactive communication processes during IR, the cognitive theory provides a comprehensive view of these processes. It encompasses the ad hoc theories of text retrieval and IR techniques hitherto developed in mainstream retrieval research. It has elements in common with van Rijsbergen and Lalmas' logical uncertainty theory and may be regarded as compatible with that conception of IR. Epistemologically speaking, the theory views IR interaction as processes of cognition, potentially occurring in all the information processing components of IR, that may be applied, in particular, to the user in a situational context. The theory draws upon basic empirical results from information seeking investigations in the operational online environment, and from mainstream IR research on partial matching techniques and relevance feedback. By viewing users, source systems, intermediary mechanisms and information in a global context, the cognitive perspective attempts a comprehensive understanding of essential IR phenomena and concepts, such as the nature of information needs, cognitive inconsistency and retrieval overlaps, logical uncertainty, the concept of `document', relevance measures and experimental settings. An inescapable consequence of this approach is to rely more on sociological and psychological investigative methods when evaluating systems and to view relevance in IR as situational, relative, partial, differentiated and non-linear. The lack of consistency among authors, indexers, evaluators or users is of an identical cognitive nature. It is unavoidable, and indeed favourable to IR. In particular, for full-text retrieval, alternative semantic entities, including Salton et al.'s `passage retrieval', are proposed to replace the traditional document record as the basic retrieval entity. These empirically observed phenomena of inconsistency and of semantic entities and values associated with data interpretation support strongly a cognitive approach to IR and the logical use of polyrepresentation, cognitive overlaps, and both data fusion and data diffusion.",

        "abstract": "Temporal dynamics and how they impact upon various components of information retrieval (IR) systems have received a large share of attention in the last decade. In particular, the study of relevance in information retrieval can now be framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches, which explain how user behavior, document content and scale vary with time, and how we can use them in our favor in order to improve retrieval effectiveness. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of temporal IR approaches, centered on the following questions: what are temporal dynamics, why do they occur, and when and how to leverage temporal information throughout the search cycle and architecture. We first explain the general and wide aspects associated to temporal dynamics by focusing on the web domain, from content and structural changes to variations of user behavior and interactions. Next, we pinpoint several research issues and the impact of such temporal characteristics on search, essentially regarding processing dynamic content, temporal query analysis and time-aware ranking. We also address particular aspects of temporal information extraction (for instance, how to timestamp documents and generate temporal profiles of text). To this end, we present existing temporal search engines and applications in related research areas, e.g., exploration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as well as future event retrieval and prediction, where the time dimension also plays an important role.",

        "abstract": "An alternative approach to evaluation of interactive information retrieval (IIR) systems, referred to as the IIR evaluation model, is proposed. The model provides a framework for the collection and analysis of IR interaction data. The aim of the model is two-fold: 1) to facilitate the evaluation of IIR systems as realistically as possible with reference to actual information searching and retrieval processes, though still in a relatively controlled evaluation environment; and 2) to calculate the IIR system performance taking into account the non-binary nature of the assigned relevance assessments. The IIR evaluation model is presented as an alternative to the system-driven Cranfield model (Cleverdon, Mills & Keen, 1966; Cleverdon & Keen, 1966) which still is the dominant approach to the evaluation of IR and IIR systems. Key elements of the IIR evaluation model are the use of realistic scenarios, known as simulated work task situations, and the (call for) alternative performance measures. A simulated work task situation, which is a short 'cover story', serves two main functions: 1) it triggers and develops a simulated information need by allowing for user interpretations of the situation, leading to cognitively individual information need interpretations as in real life; and 2) it is the platform against which situational relevance is judged. Further, by being the same for all test persons experimental control is provided. Hence, the concept of a simulated work task situation ensures the experiment both realism and control. Guidelines and recommendations for the application of simulated work task situations are provided. Examples of alternative performance measures are: relative relevance (RR), ranked half-life (RHL) (Borlund & Ingwersen, 1998), cumulated gain (CG) and cumulated gain with discount (DCG) (J\u00e4rvelin & Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen, 2000).  These measures can incorporate non-binary relevance assessments, necessary due to the result of realistic interaction and relevance assessment behaviour of users in the process of searching and assessing relevance of retrieved information objects.",

        "abstract": "The total infrared (IR) luminosity is very useful for estimating the star\r\nformation rate (SFR) of galaxies, but converting the IR luminosity into an SFR\r\nrelies on assumptions that do not hold for all galaxies. We test the\r\neffectiveness of the IR luminosity as an SFR indicator by applying it to\r\nsynthetic spectral energy distributions generated from three-dimensional\r\nhydrodynamical simulations of isolated disc galaxies and galaxy mergers. In\r\ngeneral, the SFR inferred from the IR luminosity agrees well with the true\r\ninstantaneous SFR of the simulated galaxies. However, for the major mergers in\r\nwhich a strong starburst is induced, the SFR inferred from the IR luminosity\r\ncan overestimate the instantaneous SFR during the post-starburst phase by\r\ngreater than two orders of magnitude. Even though the instantaneous SFR\r\ndecreases rapidly after the starburst, the stars that were formed in the\r\nstarburst remain dust-obscured and thus produce significant IR luminosity.\r\nConsequently, use of the IR luminosity as an SFR indicator may cause one to\r\nconclude that post-starburst galaxies are still star-forming, whereas in\r\nreality, star formation was recently quenched.",

This\nbecomes evident when studying different spatial scales within galaxies. We\ninvestigate the correlation between the infrared (IR) and free-free/synchrotron\nradio continuum emission at 20 cm from the two local group galaxies M31 and M33\non spatial scales between 0.4 and 10 kpc. The multi-scale radio-IR correlations\nhave been carried out using a wavelet analysis. The free-free and IR emission\nare correlated on all scales, but on some scales the synchrotron emission is\nonly marginally correlated with the IR emission. The synchrotron-IR correlation\nis stronger in M33 than in M31 on small scales (&lt;1 kpc), but it is weaker than\nin M31 on larger scales. Taking the smallest scale on which the synchrotron-IR\ncorrelation exists as the propagation length of cosmic ray electrons, we show\nthat the difference on small scales can be explained by the smaller propagation\nlength in M33 than in M31. On large scales, the difference is due to the thick\ndisk/halo in M33, which is absent in M31. A comparison of our data with data on\nNGC6946, the LMC and M51 suggests that the propagation length is determined by\nthe ratio of ordered-to-turbulent magnetic field strength, which is consistent\nwith diffusion of CR electrons in the ISM. As the diffusion length of CR\nelectrons influences the radio-IR correlation, this dependence is a direct\nobservational evidence of the importance of magnetic fields for the radio-IR\ncorrelation within galaxies. The star formation rate per surface area only\nindirectly influences the diffusion length as it increases the strength of the\nturbulent magnetic field.",

        "abstract": "We report the detection of far-IR CO rotational emission from the\r\nprototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. Using Herschel-PACS, we have detected\r\n10 transitions in the J_upper=14-24 (E_upper/k_B = 580-1656 K) range, all of\r\nwhich are consistent with arising from within the central 10&quot; (700 pc). The\r\ndetected transitions are modeled as arising from 2 different components: a\r\nmoderate excitation (ME) component close to the galaxy systemic velocity, and a\r\nhigh excitation (HE) component that is blueshifted by ~70 km s^-1. We employ\r\na large velocity gradient (LVG) model and derive n_H2~10^5.7 cm^-3,\r\nT_kin~150 K, and M_H2~10^6.9 M_sun for the ME component, and n_H2~10^6.3\r\ncm^-3, T_kin~440 K, and M_H2~10^5.8 M_sun for the HE component, although\r\nfor both components the uncertainties in the density and mass are ~plus/minus 1\r\ndex. Both components arise from denser and possibly warmer gas than traced by\r\nlow-J CO transitions, and the ME component likely makes a significant\r\ncontribution to the mass budget in the nuclear region. We compare the CO line\r\nprofiles with those of other molecular tracers observed at higher spatial and\r\nspectral resolution, and find that the ME transitions are consistent with these\r\nlines arising in the ~200 pc diameter ring of material traced by H_2 1-0 S(1)\r\nobservations. The blueshift of the HE lines may also be consistent with the\r\nbluest regions of this H_2 ring, but a better kinematic match is found with a\r\nclump of infalling gas ~40 pc north of the AGN. We consider potential heating\r\nmechanisms, and conclude that X-ray or shock heating of both components is\r\nviable, while far-UV heating is unlikely. We also report sensitive upper limits\r\nextending up to J_upper=50, which place constraints on the emission from the\r\nX-ray obscuring medium.",

In particular local search services have become a widely used mechanism to find businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, which satisfy a geographical restriction. Unfortunately, many useful types of geographic restrictions are currently not supported in these systems, including restrictions that specify the neighborhood in which the business should be located. As the boundaries of city neighborhoods are not readily available, automated techniques to construct representations of the spatial extent of neighborhoods are required to support this kind of restrictions. In this paper, we propose such a technique, using fuzzy footprints to cope with the inherent vagueness of most neighborhood boundaries, and we provide experimental results that demonstrate the potential of our technique in a local search setting.",

We present a new IR filter approach based on a\r\ncombination of patterned frequency selective structures on silicon and a thin\r\n(50 $m$ thick) absorptive composite based on powdered reststrahlen\r\nabsorbing materials. For a 300 K blackbody, this combination reflects\r\n$\\sim$50\\% of the incoming light and blocks 99.8\\% of the total\r\npower with negligible thermal gradients and excellent low frequency\r\ntransmission. This allows for a reduction in the IR thermal loading to\r\nnegligible levels in a single cold filter. These composite filters are\r\nfabricated on silicon substrates which provide excellent thermal transport\r\nlaterally through the filter and ensure that the entire area of the absorptive\r\nfilter stays near the bath temperature. A metamaterial antireflection coating\r\ncut into these substrates reduces in-band reflections to below 1\\%, and the\r\nin-band absorption of the powder mix is below 1\\% for signal bands below 750\r\nGHz. This type of filter can be directly incorporated into silicon refractive\r\noptical elements.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes evaluation methods based on the use of non-dichotomous relevance judgements in IR experiments. It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modern large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In-Query1) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.",

        "abstract": "(Abridged) Galactic archaeology aims to determine the evolution of the Galaxy\r\nfrom the chemical and kinematical properties of its stars. The analysis of\r\ncurrent large spectroscopic surveys (thousands of stars) and future ones\r\n(millions of stars) require automated analysis techniques to obtain robust\r\nestimates of the stellar parameters. Several on-going and planned spectroscopic\r\nsurveys have selected their wavelength region to contain the IR CaII triplet\r\nand this paper focuses on the automatic analysis of such spectra.\r\n  We investigated two algorithms, MATISSE and DEGAS, both of which compare the\r\nobserved spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra, but each uses a different\r\nmathematical approach for finding the optimum match and hence the best stellar\r\nparameters.\r\n  We identified degeneracies in different regions of the HR diagram: hot dwarfs\r\nand giants share the same spectral signatures. Furthermore, the surface gravity\r\nof cooler dwarfs is difficult to determine accurately. These effects are\r\nintensified when the information decreases (e.g. metal-poor stars or low SNR\r\nspectra). Our results show that the local projection method MATISSE is\r\npreferred for high SNR spectra, whereas the decision-tree method DEGAS is\r\npreferred for noisier spectra. We therefore propose a hybrid approach of both\r\nmethods and show that sufficiently accurate results for the purposes of\r\ngalactic archaeology are retrieved down to SNR~20 for typical thin or thick\r\ndisc stars, and down to SNR~50 for the more metal-poor halo giants.\r\n  If unappreciated, degeneracies in stellar parameters can introduce biases in\r\nderived quantities for target stars such as distances and full space motions.\r\nThese biases can be minimised using the knowledge gained by thorough testing of\r\nthe proposed algorithm, which in turn lead to robust automated methods for the\r\ncoming extensive stellar spectroscopic surveys in the Local Group.",

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of huge amounts of (heterogeneous) data on the Web, the importance of information retrieval (IR) has grown considerably over the last few years. Big players in the computer industry, such as Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!, are the primary contributors of technology for fast access to Web-based information; and searching capabilities are now integrated into most information systems, ranging from business management software and customer relationship systems to social networks and mobile phone applications. Ceri and his co-authors aim at taking their readers from the foundations of modern information retrieval to the most advanced challenges of Web IR. To this end, their book is divided into three parts. The first part addresses the principles of IR and provides a systematic and compact description of basic information retrieval techniques (including binary, vector space and probabilistic models as well as natural language search processing) before focusing on its application to the Web. Part two addresses the foundational aspects of Web IR by discussing the general architecture of search engines (with a focus on the crawling and indexing processes), describing link analysis methods (specifically Page Rank and HITS), addressing recommendation and diversification, and finally presenting advertising in search (the main source of revenues for search engines). The third and final part describes advanced aspects of Web search, each chapter providing a self-contained, up-to-date survey on current Web research directions. Topics in this part include meta-search and multi-domain search, semantic search, search in the context of multimedia data, and crowd search.",

We calculate\r\nSFR$_total$ and compare it with other SFR estimates (H$\\alpha$, UV, SDSS)\r\nfinding a very good agreement between them with smaller dispersions than\r\ntypical SFR uncertainties. We study the effect of mass and metallicity, finding\r\nthat it is only significant at high masses for SFR$_H\\alpha$. For the AGN and\r\ncomposite galaxies we find a tight correlation between SFR and L$_IR$\r\n($\\sigma\\sim$0.29), while the dispersion in the SFR - L$_UV$ relation is\r\nlarger ($\\sigma\\sim$0.57).

Traditional international relations theories (IRT) have probed the laws of IR, in an attempt to become the universal science. IRT have developed into a class doctrine that defends the legitimacy of the western international system as a result of proceeding from the reality of IR, while neglecting its evolving process, and overlooking the meaning of art and the presence of multi-international systems. In other words, IRT have turned into what Karl Marx might have deemed as the vulgar international relations theories (VIRT). For this reason, we declare the end of international relations theories. This phenomenon can only be negated by the so-called Chinese School, which will set the sustainable and harmonious relations among nations, between state and non-state actors, and within states and non-state actors (in one word `global-society') in five life-forces of economy, politics, military, culture, and religion. Consequently, this will bring about a real regression of nationality and compatible development of various international systems.",

        "abstract": "In ablation-based single particle mass spectrometry it is common to find that the mass spectra of particles with identical compositions exhibit significant particle-to-particle fluctuations and high degree of fragmentation. This is particularly true when it comes to particles containing organic compounds. At laser fluence that is sufficient to ionize sulfates, mass spectra of the identical organic particles are classified into multitude of classes, some of which are indistinguishable from elemental carbon. In contrast, the individual particle mass spectra generated in two-step mode, in which an IR laser pulse is used to evaporate the semivolatile particle components and a time delayed UV laser pulse is used to ionize the evaporating plume, exhibit greatly diminished particle-to-particle fluctuations and significantly improved mass spectral quality. Since individual particle mass spectra must first be classified and only then can be averaged and analyzed, the IR/UV mode greatly improves the capability to properly quantify particle compositions. We present an experimental investigation of the properties and behavior of individual particle mass spectra of organic particles that are generated by ablation and in the two-step mode as function of UV laser fluence and the delay between the two lasers. The study shows that the two-step mode yields highly reproducible mass spectra that contain sufficient detail to allow molecular identification. In addition it produces significantly higher mass spectral intensities that are linearly related to the mass of organics in the particles. In contrast, ablation generated mass spectra were found to exhibit high degree of fragmentation and large particle-to-particle fluctuations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes evaluation methods based on the use of non-dichotomous relevance judgements in IR experiments. It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modern large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In-Query<sup>1</sup>) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.",

The relative lack of knowledge of the coronal vector\nmagnetic field is a major handicap for progress in coronal physics. This makes\nthe development of measurement methods of coronal magnetic fields a high\npriority in solar physics. The Hanle effect in the UV and IR spectral lines is\na largely unexplored diagnostic. We use magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations\nto study the magnitude of the signal to be expected for typical coronal\nmagnetic fields for selected spectral lines in the UV and IR wavelength ranges,\nnamely the H I Ly-\\$\\alpha\\$ and the He I 10830 \\AA lines. We show that the\nselected lines are useful for reliable diagnosis of coronal magnetic fields.\nThe results show that the combination of polarization measurements of spectral\nlines with different sensitivities to the Hanle effect may be most appropriate\nfor deducing coronal magnetic properties from future observations.",

        "abstract": "Cisplatin cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) was the first platinum-based antineoplastic agent and is still a cornerstone for the treatment of various solid tumors. Reactive events responsible for cisplatin activity are unveiled here at the molecular level. Simple ligands (L) representing ubiquitous functional groups in the biological environment likely to be encountered by administered cisplatin have been allowed to react with cis-PtCl(NH3)2(H2O)+, the primary intermediate from cisplatin hydrolysis. The substitution reactions have been examined by a combined experimental and computational approach and the structural features of the substitution product, cis-PtCl(NH3)2(L)+, have been probed by IR multiple-photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. Furthermore, IRMPD spectroscopy has been exploited to elucidate the structure of PtCl(NH3)2(L)(H2O)+ clusters, also obtained by electrospray ionization (ESI) from the aqueous solution and representing the major focus of this investigation. These ions conform to the encounter complex of cis-PtCl(NH3)2(H2O)+ with the incoming ligand and represent the first direct evidence of a prototypical Eigen\u2013Wilkins encounter complex in solution, lying on the reaction coordinate for ligand substitution and extracted by ESI for mass spectrometric analysis. Activated PtCl(NH3)2(L)(H2O)+ ions dissociate by the loss of either H2O or L, the former process implying a ligand substitution event. IRMPD spectroscopy has thus revealed both structural details and reaction dynamics at the level of the isolated encounter complex.",

        "abstract": "We present a gesture recognition system for recognizing hand movements in near realtime. The system uses a infra-red time-of-flight range camera with up to 30 Hz framerate to measure 3d-surface points captured from the hand of the user. The measured data is transformed into a cloud of 3d-points after depth keying and suppression of camera noise by median filtering. Principle component analysis (PCA) is used to obtain a first crude estimate on the location and orientation of the hand. An articulated hand model is fitted to the data to refine the first estimate. The unoptimized system is able to estimate the first 7 Degrees of Freedom of the hand within 200 ms. The reconstructed hand is visualized in AVANGO/Performer and can be utilized to implement a natural man-machine interface. The work reviews relevant publications, underlines the advantages and shortcomings of the approach and provides an outlook on future improvements.",

We also observed an additional intermetallic phase, with a stoichiometry corresponding to Al13Ir4; however, this compound exhibits a complex X-ray pattern and currently no structure has been determined.\r\nPeritectic temperatures were determined for Al9Ir2 (900 \u00b0C), Al13Ir4 (1015 \u00b0C) and Al3Ir (1450 \u00b0C). The Al2.7Ir phase is stable to above 1450 \u00b0C, and the congruent melting temperature of AlIr is 2120 \u00b1 20 \u00b0C. The solubility of aluminum in iridium was measured between 1085 and 1850 \u00b0C, and the maximum solid solubility was extrapolated to 18 at.% at 2058 \u00b0C. The maximum solid solubility of iridium in aluminum was measured to be less than 0.1 at.%. A phase diagram for the Al---Ir system is presented.",

        "abstract": "Modern large retrieval environments tend to overwhelm their users by their large output. Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences.

We collected 103 papers published between 2003-2009 which mention FCA and information retrieval in the abstract, title or keywords. Using a prototype of our FCA-based toolset CORDIET, we converted the pdf-files containing the papers to plain text, indexed them with Lucene using a thesaurus containing terms related to FCA research and then created the concept lattice shown in this paper. We visualized, analyzed and explored the literature with concept lattices and discovered multiple interesting research streams in IR of which we give an extensive overview. The core contributions of this paper are the innovative application of FCA to the text mining of scientific papers and the survey of the FCA-based IR research.",

Analysis involves distinctions between \u201cpositivism\u201d and \u201cpragmatism\u201d and \u201cclassical\u201d\r\nversus Kuhnian understandings of concepts.\r\nFindings \u2013 Classification, both manual and automatic, for retrieval benefits from drawing upon a\r\ncombination of qualitative and quantitative techniques, a consideration of theories of meaning, and the\r\nadding of top-down approaches to IR in which divisions of labour, domains, traditions, genres,\r\ndocument architectures etc. are included as analytical elements and in which specific IR algorithms are\r\nbased on the examination of specific literatures. Introduces an example illustrating the consequences\r\nof a full implementation of a pragmatist understanding when handling homonyms.\r\nPractical implications \u2013 Outlines how to classify from a pragmatic-philosophical point of view.\r\nOriginality/value \u2013 Provides, emphasizing a pragmatic understanding, insights of importance to\r\nclassification for retrieval, both manual and automatic.",

Comparative analysis of the bond order, which dictates the bond strength, the localization of the valence electrons and the elastic constants of Ir and a selection of fcc metals allows us to rationalize the peculiarities of Ir in terms of its strong and directional bonds. Furthermore, the similarities between the failures of\u00a0Al and Ir are suggested to reflect the resemblance existing between the angular features of their\u00a0bonds.",

        "abstract": "We compute and study the infrared and sub-mm properties of high redshift\r\n(z>1) simulated clusters and proto-clusters, by coupling the results of a large\r\nset of hydro-dynamical zoom-in simulations including active galactic nuclei\r\n(AGN) feedback (Ragone-Figueroa et al. 2013), with the recently developed\r\nradiative transfer code GRASIL3D (Dominguez-Tenreiro et al. 2014), which\r\naccounts for the effect of dust reprocessing in an arbitrary geometry, and we\r\ncustomized for the present purpose. While this field is in its infancy from the\r\nobservational point of view, a rapid development is expected in the near\r\nfuture, thanks to observations performed in the far IR and sub-mm bands.\r\nNotably, we find that in this spectral regime our prediction are little\r\naffected by the assumption required by this post-processing, and the emission\r\nis mostly powered by star formation rather than accretion onto super massive\r\nblack hole (SMBH). The comparison with the little observational information\r\navailable so far, highlights that the simulated cluster regions never attain\r\nthe impressive star formation rates suggested by these observations. This\r\nproblem becomes more intriguing taking into account that the brightest cluster\r\ngalaxies (BCGs) in the same simulations turns out to be too massive\r\n(Ragone-Figueroa et al. 2013). It seems that the interplay between the feedback\r\nschemes and the starformation model should be revised, possibly incorporating a\r\npositive feedback mode.",

In this paper, we consider Information Retrieval systems exploiting geographic dimensions: spatial, temporal, and topical dimensions. Our contribution is twofold as we propose a Geographic Information Retrieval system evaluation framework and test the following hypothesis: combining spatial and temporal dimensions along with the topical dimension improves the effectiveness of Information Retrieval systems.",

        "abstract": "Localized electron spins can couple magnetically via the Ruderman\u2013Kittel\u2013Kasuya\u2013Yosida interaction even if their wave functions lack direct overlap. Theory predicts that spin\u2013orbit scattering leads to a Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya type enhancement of this indirect exchange interaction, giving rise to chiral exchange terms. Here we present a combined spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, angle-resolved photoemission, and density functional theory study of MnO2 chains on Ir(100). Whereas we find antiferromagnetic Mn\u2013Mn coupling along the chain, the inter-chain coupling across the non-magnetic Ir substrate turns out to be chiral with a 120\u00b0 rotation between adjacent MnO2 chains. Calculations reveal that the Dzyaloshinskii\u2013Moriya interaction results in spin spirals with a periodicity in agreement with experiment. Our findings confirm the existence of indirect chiral magnetic exchange, potentially giving rise to exotic phenomena, such as chiral spin-liquid states in spin ice systems or the emergence of new quasiparticles.",

Our study demonstrates for the first time the\n   quantitative, accurate and reproducible determination of the\n   concentration of a rhodium catalyst by means of IR spectroscopy and,\n   moreover, allows the investigation of intermolecular interactions.\n   Spectral features, located mainly in the fingerprint region of the IR\n   spectrum, are identified revealing the influence of the dissolved\n   catalyst on the IL's vibrational structure. In particular, the\n   ring-bending mode of the imidazolium ring shows a frequency shift as a\n   function of catalyst concentration, probably due to hydrogen-bond\n   formation between the IL cation and the Rh complex. The results show\n   the potential of IR spectroscopy both for application as a quick\n   process control technology in catalytic processes and as a toot for\n   better understanding of IL-catalyst interactions.",

The catalysts involve complexes with oxidation states: Ir(I), Ir(III), Pt(0), and Pt(II). It is demonstrated that for these heavy 5d transition metal-containing systems, the SOC effect and outer-core correlation effect on C\u00e2\u0080\u0093H activation are up to the order of \u00e2\u0088\u00bc1 kcal/mol, and should be included if chemical accuracy is aimed. The interesting trends in our studied systems are: (1) the SOC effect consistently increases the C\u00e2\u0080\u0093H activation barriers and is apparently larger in higher oxidation states (Pt(II) and Ir(III)) than in low-oxidation states (Pt(0) and Ir(I)); and (2) the magnitude of outer-core (5s5p) correlation effects is larger in less coordinate-saturated system. The effect of basis set on the outer-core correlation correction is significant; larger basis sets tend to increase the C\u00e2\u0080\u0093H activation barriers.",

Most approaches combining indexing techniques from both .elds still separate path and content matching, merging the hits in an expensive join. This paper shows that retrieval is signi.cantly accelerated by processing text and structure simultaneously. The Content-Aware DataGuide (CADG) interleaves IR and DB indexing techniques to minimize path matching and suppress joins at query time, also saving needless I/O operations during retrieval. Extensive experiments prove the CADG to outperform the DataGuide 11,14 by a factor 5 to 200 on average. For structurally unselective queries, it is over 400 times faster than the DataGuide. The best results were achieved on large collections of heterogeneously structured textual documents.",

We present\r\npredictions for blind surveys, each of 1000 h, with different mapped areas (a\r\nshallow survey covering an area of 10 deg$^2$ and a deep survey of 1\r\ndeg$^2$) and two different concepts of the OST/OSS: with a 5.9 m telescope\r\n(Concept 2, our reference configuration) and with a 9.1 m telescope (Concept 1,\r\nprevious configuration). In 1000 h, surveys with the reference concept will\r\ndetect from $1.9 10^6$ to $8.7 10^6$ lines from\r\n$4.8 10^5$-$2.7 10^6$ star-forming galaxies and from\r\n$1.4 10^4$ to $3.8 10^4$ lines from $1.3\r\n10^4$-$3.5 10^4$ AGNs. The shallow survey will detect\r\nsubstantially more sources than the deep one; the advantage of the latter in\r\npushing detections to lower luminosities/higher redshifts turns out to be quite\r\nlimited. The OST/OSS will reach, in the same observing time, line fluxes more\r\nthan one order of magnitude fainter than the SPICA/SMI and will cover a much\r\nbroader redshift range. In particular it will detect tens of thousands of\r\ngalaxies at $z 5$, beyond the reach of that instrument. The polycyclic\r\naromatic hydrocarbons lines are potentially bright enough to allow the\r\ndetection of hundreds of thousands of star-forming galaxies up to $z 8.5$,\r\ni.e. all the way through the re-ionization epoch. The proposed surveys will\r\nallow us to explore the galaxy-AGN co-evolution up to $z5.5-6$ with very\r\ngood statistics.

        "abstract": "Pervasive Computing is also called as Ubiquitous Computing, which means \u201cbeing present everywhere at once\u201d or \u201cconstantly encountered\u201d. The main idea behind making these pervasive computing systems is that these systems improve living by performing computations on their own, without having to be monitored by anyone. These systems are targeted to become invisible to the user i.e., they perform their tasks without the user\u2019s knowledge. \nTo achieve this environment, the underlying requirement is a Network. One of the biggest constraints in achieving this environment is the \u201cLast Mile\u201d problem. It refers to the last leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer. In recent years there has been increasing interest shown in wireless technologies for subscriber access, as an alternative to traditional twisted-pair local loop. \nWiMAX, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, is a Telecommunications technology that provides wireless transmission of data and is based on the IEEE 802.16 standard (also called Broadband Wireless Access). 802.16 uses paired radio channels Up Link Channel (UL) and Down Link Channel (DL) for establishing a communication between Base Station (BS) and Subscriber Station (SS). When a SS wants to establish connectivity with a BS it goes through the Network Entry and Initialization procedure of which Initial Ranging (IR) is a very important part. IR is the process of acquiring the correct timing offset and power adjustments such that the SS\u2019s transmissions are aligned to maintain the UL connection with the BS. All the SS\u2019s of a BS will compete for the contention slots for their network entry. Whenever the SS has to transmit the request packets it performs the Truncated Binary Exponential Backoff procedure. This method is the contention resolution procedure used in IEEE 802.16 networks. \nOur focus here was to simulate a WiMAX network so as to evaluate the performance of MAC IEEE 802.16 during the IR phase of Network Entry and Initialization. We have used Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) for our simulation purposes. We are using WiMAX \u201cpatch\u201d which simulates the PHY and the MAC features of a WiMAX network. We have evaluated the performance of MAC IEEE 802.16 for various topologies.",

        "abstract": "The international relations (IR) discipline is dominated by the American research community. Data about publication patterns in leading journals document this situation as well as a variance in theoretical orientations. IR is conducted differently in different places. The main patterns are explained through a sociology of science model that emphasizes the different nine- teen th-century histories of the state, the early format of social science, and the institutionalized delineation among the different social sciences. The internal social and intellectual structure of American IR is two-tiered, with relatively independent subfields and a top layer defined by access to the leading journals (on which IR, in contrast to some social sciences, has a high consensus). The famous successive 'great debates' serve an important function by letting lead theorists focus and structure the whole discipline. IR in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom has historically been structured differently, often with power vested more locally. American IR now moves in a direction that undermines its global hegemony. The widespread turn to rational choice privileges a reintegration (and status-wise rehabilitation) with the rest of political science over attention to JR practices elsewhere. This rationalistic turn is alien to Europeans, both because their IR is generally closer to sociology, philosophy, and anthropology, and because the liberal ontological premises of rational choice are less fitting to European societies. Simultaneously, European IR is beginning to break the local power bastions and establish independent research communities at a national or, increasingly, a European level. As American IR turns from global hegemony to national professionalization, IR becomes more pluralistic.",

        "abstract": "An attractive method to broaden the absorption bandwidth of polymer/fullerene-based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is to blend near infrared (near-IR) sensitizers into the host system. Axial substitution of silicon phthalocyanines (Pcs) opens a possibility to modify the chemical, thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties. Different axial substitutions are already designed to modify the thermodynamic properties of Pcs, but the impact of extending the \u03c0-conjugation of the axial ligand on the opto-electronic properties, as a function of the length of the alkyl spacer, has not been investigated yet. For this purpose, a novel series of pyrene-substituted silicon phthalocyanines (SiPc-Pys) with varying lengths of alkyl chain tethers are synthesized. The UV\u2013vis and external quantum efficiency (EQE) results exhibit an efficient near IR sensitization up to 800 nm, clearly establishing the impact of the pyrene substitution. This yields an increase of over 20% in the short circuit current density (J\r\nSC) and over 50% in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the dye-sensitized ternary device. Charge generation, transport properties, and microstructure are studied using different advanced technologies. Remarkably, these results provide guidance for the diverse and judicious selection of dye sensitizers to overcome the absorption limitation and achieve high efficiency ternary solar cells.",

        "abstract": "The Ce(Co,Rh,Ir)In$_5$ family of ``Ce-115'' materials hosts an abundance of\r\ncorrelated electron behavior, including heavy-fermion physics, magnetism,\r\nsuperconductivity and nematicity. The complicated behavior of these entangled\r\nphenomena leads to a variety of exotic physical properties, which, despite the\r\nseemingly simple crystal structure of these compounds, remain poorly\r\nunderstood. It is generally accepted that the interplay between the itinerant\r\nand local character of Ce-$4f$ electrons is the key to their exotic behavior.\r\nHere, we report theoretical evidence that the Ce-115 materials are also\r\ntopological semi-metals, with Dirac fermions around well-separated nodes. Dirac\r\nnodes in each compound are present on the $\\Gamma-Z$ plane close to the Fermi\r\nlevel. As the Dirac bands are derived from In-orbitals, they occur in all\r\nfamily members irrespective of the transition metal (Co,Rh,Ir). We present the\r\nexpected Fermi-arc surface state patterns and show the close proximity of a\r\ntopological Lifshitz transition, which possibly explains the high field physics\r\nof Ce-115 materials. Experimentally, we highlight the surprising similarity of\r\nCe(Co,Rh,Ir)In$_5$ in high magnetic fields, despite the distinctly different\r\nstates of the Ce-$4f$ electrons. These results raise questions about the role\r\nDirac fermions play in exotic transport behavior, and we propose this class of\r\nmaterials as a prime candidate for unconventional topological\r\nsuperconductivity.",

        "abstract": "As an extension to the current Web, Semantic Web will not only contain structured data with machine understandable semantics but also textual information.  While structured queries can be used to find information more precisely on the Semantic Web, keyword searches are still needed to help exploit textual information.  It thus becomes very important that we can combine precise structured queries with imprecise keyword searches to have a hybrid query capability. In addition, due to the huge volume of information on the Semantic Web, the hybrid query must be processed in a very scalable way. In this paper, we define such a hybrid query capability that combines unary tree-shaped structured queries with keyword searches. We show how existing information retrieval (IR) index structures and functions can be reused to index semantic web data and its textual information, and how the hybrid query is evaluated on the index structure using IR engines in an efficient and scalable manner. We implemented this IR approach in an engine called Semplore. Comprehensive experiments on its performance show that it is a promising approach. It leads us to believe that it may be possible to evolve current web search engines to query and search the Semantic Web. Finally, we breifly describe how Semplore is used for searching Wikipedia and an IBM customer's product information.",

Besides there is hardly any data available in Indian population. Sofurther research is needed to explore the complex interaction between environmental factors and eNOS 786T C gene polymorphism in susceptibility to insulin resistance in patients with CAD in Indian population.AIM This study aimed to study the association of Insulin Resistance, Nitric Oxide and intergenotypic variation of endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase T786C gene polymorphism among coronary artery disease subjects. METHODOLOGY This study consisted of 60 adult patients of with documented CAD and 60 age and sex matched healthy subjects as controls.Fasting Serum Insulin was measured by ELISA,fasting Serum nitric oxide by modified Griess reaction and fasting plasma glucose on fully automated chemistry analyzer Hitachi 902 HOMA IR was calculated mathematically by using formula given by Matthew et al. The eNOS gene loci was amplified by using PCR and by RFLP. A p value 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed with the help of SPSS version.. RESULTS Intergenotypic levels of nitric oxide were significantly lower in TC genotype than TT both in study as well as control groups. Also, TC genotype showed significantly higher HOMA IR levels as compared to TT genotype in both study as well as control group. Moreover, CC genotype could not be found in both cases and control groups..Thus, TT genotype may have a protective role in development of insulin resistance and coronary artery disease as seen by high Nitric Oxide levels and low HOMA IR levels in TT genotype than TC genotypes in both case as well as control groups.CONCLUSIONS Endothelial nitric oxide synthase t786c gene polymorphism tt genotype is associated with high nitric oxide levels and low homa ir levels in coronary artery disease patients.

        "abstract": "IR and EPR spectroscopic investigations of redox- p-doped semiconducting (6,5) single-wall carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) were used to study carrier localization and delocalization from low- up to degenerate doping levels. At low carrier concentrations, the analysis of IR-intraband transitions as well as the appearance of a doping-induced vibrational D-band anti-resonance, point to charge-localization on the few nm length-scale. Moreover, the rise of a spin 1/2 signal in EPR closely tracks the increase of the doping level, supporting the notion of charge-localization at low carrier concentrations. At doping levels exceeding 0.1 nm-1, EPR data as well as intra- and D-band absorption in the IR point to antiferromagnetic coupling between surplus charge carriers becoming dominant. These results are expected to be relevant for field- or redox-chemical doping of s-SWNTs in any polarizable, heterogeneous environment.",

        "abstract": "Abstract XML information retrieval (XML-IR) systems differ from traditional information retrieval systems by using structure of XML documents to retrieve more specific units of information than the documents themselves. Users interact with XML-IR systems via structured queries that express their content and structural requirements. Historically, it has been common belief within the XML-IR community that structured queries will perform better than traditional keyword-only queries. However, recent system-orientated analysis has show that this assumption may be incorrect when system performance is averaged over a set of queries. Here, we test this assumption with users via a simulated work task experiment. We compare a keyword only interface with two user friendly XML-IR interfaces: NLPX, a natural language interface and Bricks, a query-bytemplate interface. This is the first time that a XML-IR natural language interface has been tested in user experiments. We compare the retrieval performance of all three interfaces and the usability of the two structured interfaces. Our results correspond to those of the system-orientated evaluation and indicate that structured queries do not aid retrieval performance. They also show that in terms of retrieval performance and usability the structured interfaces are comparable.",

        "abstract": "If the adiabatic approximation is valid, electrons smoothly adapt to molecular geometry changes. In contrast, as a characteristic of diabatic dynamics, the electron density does not follow the nuclear motion. Recently, we have shown that the asymmetry in time-resolved photoelectron spectra serves as a tool to distinguish between these dynamics Falge et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2012, 3, 2617. Here, we investigate the influence of an additional, moderately intense infrared (IR) laser field, as often applied in attosecond time-resolved experiments, on such asymmetries. This is done using a simple model for coupled electronic-nuclear motion. We calculate time-resolved photoelectron spectra and their asymmetries and demonstrate that the spectra directly map the bound electron-nuclear dynamics. From the asymmetries, we can trace the IR field-induced population transfer and both the field-driven and intrinsic (non-)adiabatic dynamics. This holds true when considering superposition states accompanied by electronic coherences. The latter are observable in the asymmetries for sufficiently short XUV pulses to coherently probe the coupled states. It is thus documented that the asymmetry is a measure for phases in bound electron wave packets and non-adiabatic dynamics.",

        "abstract": "This article attempts to lay down theoretical groundwork for information retrieval (IR) that involves the combined efforts of several users. It is argued that the fundamental intellectual problems of IR are the production and consumption of knowledge. Knowledge production is fundamentally a collaborative labor, which is deeply embedded in the practices of a community of participants constituting a domain. The current technological advances in networked systems make the intertextual and intersubjective nature of meaning production and communication readily visible by merging various heterogeneous media into the homogenizing framework of the digital medium. Collaborative IR as envisaged in this article would be based on the ethos of voluntary cooperation to facilitate free exchange of ideas and stimulate creativity. What sorts of functionalities can be expected in a Collaborative IR system are illustrated with the help of some examples of collaborative systems and services from various domains. \\copyright 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "abstract": "We present near-infrared emission line counts and luminosity functions from\r\nthe HST WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallels (WISP) program for 29 fields\r\nobserved using both the G102 and G141 grism. Altogether we identify 1048\r\nemission line galaxies with observed equivalent widths greater than 40\r\nAngstroms, 467 of which have multiple detected emission lines. The WISP survey\r\nis sensitive to fainter flux levels (3-5x10^-17 ergs/s/cm^2) than the future\r\nspace near-infrared grism missions aimed at baryonic acoustic oscillation\r\ncosmology (1-4x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2), allowing us to probe the fainter emission\r\nline galaxies that the shallower future surveys may miss. Cumulative number\r\ncounts of 0.7<z<1.5 galaxies are in rough agreement with the corrected count\r\npredictions of H-alpha emitters from Geach et al. (2010), reaching 10,000\r\ndeg^-2 above an H-alpha flux of 2x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2. H-alpha-emitting\r\ngalaxies with comparable OIII flux are roughly 5 times less common than\r\ngalaxies with just H-alpha emission at those flux levels. Galaxies with low\r\nH-alpha/OIII ratios are very rare at the brighter fluxes that future\r\nnear-infrared grism surveys will probe; our survey finds no galaxies with\r\nH-alpha/OIII<0.95 that have H-alpha flux greater than 3x10^-16 ergs/s/cm^2.\r\nWe also find that our high redshift (z=0.9-1.5) counts are slightly higher\r\n(factors of 1.3-2) than the high redshift (z=1.47) narrow band H-alpha survey\r\nof HiZELS (Sobral et al. 2012), although our lower redshift luminosity function\r\n(z=0.3-0.9) is consistent with their z=0.84 result. The evolution in the OIII\r\nluminosity function from z=0.7-2.3 is almost entirely in the L* parameter,\r\nwhich steadily increases with redshift over that range.",

The IR is graph-based and contains nodes fixed to control flow as well as floating nodes. Side-effecting nodes include a framestate that maps values back to the original program. Guard nodes dynamically check assumptions and, on failure, deoptimize to the interpreter that continues execution. Guards implicitly use the framestate and program position of the last side-effecting node. Therefore, they can be represented as freely floating nodes in the IR. Exception edges are modeled as explicit control flow and are subject to full optimization. We use profiling and deoptimization to speculatively reduce the number of such edges. The IR is the core of a just-in-time compiler that is integrated with the Java HotSpot VM. We evaluate the design decisions of the IR using major Java benchmark suites.",

        "abstract": "Many authors, who adopt the vector space model, take the view that documents, terms, queries, etc., are all elements within the same (conceptual) space. This view seems to be a natural one, given that documents and queries have the same vector notation. We show, however, that the structure of the query space can be very different from that of the document space. To this end, concepts like preference, similarity, term independence, and linearity, both in the document space and in the query space, are discussed. Our conclusion is that a more realistic and complete view of IR is obtained if we do not consider documents and queries to be elements of the same space. This conclusion implies that certain restrictions usually applied in the design of an IR system are obviated. For example, the retrieval function need not be restricted to the ones that have the possibility to be interpreted as a similarity measure. \\copyright 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for recognizing synonyms, based on statistical data acquired by querying a Web search engine. The algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words. PMI-IR is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions from a collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results for LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).",

Selection is based on a\r\nBayesian kernel density algorithm with a training sample of 157,701\r\nspectroscopically-confirmed type-1 quasars with both optical and mid-IR data.\r\nOf the quasar candidates, 733,713 lack spectroscopic confirmation (and 305,623\r\nare objects that we have not previously classified as photometric quasar\r\ncandidates). These candidates include 7874 objects targeted as high probability\r\npotential quasars with 3.5<z<5 (of which 6779 are new photometric candidates).\r\nOur algorithm is more complete to z>3.5 than the traditional mid-IR selection\r\n\"wedges\" and to 2.2<z<3.5 quasars than the SDSS-III/BOSS project. Number counts\r\nand luminosity function analysis suggests that the resulting catalog is\r\nrelatively complete to known quasars and is identifying new high-z quasars at\r\nz>3. This catalog paves the way for luminosity-dependent clustering\r\ninvestigations of large numbers of faint, high-redshift quasars and for further\r\nmachine learning quasar selection using Spitzer and WISE data combined with\r\nother large-area optical imaging surveys.",

        "abstract": "The HUDF09 data are the deepest near-IR observations ever, reaching to ~29.5\r\nmag. The recent sample of 132 z~7 and z~8 galaxies from the HUDF09 data are\r\ncomplemented here by new large samples at z~5 and z~6 galaxies (507 and 203,\r\nrespectively) and prior results at z~4. The luminosity functions we derive at\r\nthese redshifts reach to very faint limits of &lt;0.05L*(z=3). The faint-end\r\nslopes alpha are steep: -1.79+/-0.12 (z~5), -1.73+/-0.20 (z~6), -2.01+/-0.21\r\n(z~7), and -1.91+/-0.32 (z~8). The results are consistent with a slope that\r\nincreases systematically to earlier times, with slopes close to -2 at z~7-8.\r\nSlopes alpha ~-2 lead to formally divergent UV fluxes, though galaxies are not\r\nexpected to form below ~-10 AB mag. These results have major implications for\r\nreionization. For such steep slopes, and a faint-end limit of -10 AB mag,\r\ngalaxies provide a very large UV ionizing photon flux. Adopting typical\r\nparameters and extrapolating the current LF and faint-end slope evolution from\r\nz~4-8 to z&gt;8, we derive Thomson optical depths of 0.079, in excellent agreement\r\nwith the seven-year WMAP estimates (tau=0.088+/-0.015). It may thus not be\r\nnecessary to resort to extreme assumptions about the escape fraction or\r\nclumping factor. Nevertheless, the uncertainties are large and depend\r\ncritically on the trend to steeper faint-end slopes at z&gt;=6. We show that\r\ndeeper, and realistic, WFC3/IR+ACS observations can substantially lessen the\r\nuncertainties on the z~5-8 slopes and further constrain this key parameter in\r\ndetermining the UV ionizing flux from galaxies.",

However, if the user can identify examples of the kind of documents they require then they can employ a technique known as relevance feedback. Relevance feedback covers a range of techniques intended to improve a user's query and facilitate retrieval of information relevant to a user's information need. In this paper we survey relevance feedback techniques. We study both automatic techniques, in which the system modifies the user's query, and interactive techniques, in which the user has control over query modification. We also consider specific interfaces to relevance feedback systems and characteristics of searchers that can affect the use and success of relevance feedback systems.",

        "abstract": "1 We report observations and calculations of peroxynitric acid, HO2NO2, in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. The simulations show that photolysis of HO2NO2 via excitation of purely vibrational modes at wavelengths longward of 760 nm (the near IR) can dominate loss of this species. Consideration of this photolytic pathway reduces calculated HO2NO2, resolving a large discrepancy between standard model calculations and observations of HO2NO2 at high-latitude spring. The lower calculated abundance of HO2NO2 reduces the efficiency of the OH + HO2NO2 sink of HOx. Consideration of this process leads to large increases in calculated HOx (20 to 60%) for high-latitude spring and better agreement with observed stratospheric abundances of HOx. Near IR photolysis of HO2NO2 alters the coupling between NOx and HOx in stratospheric and upper tropospheric photochemical models.",

        "abstract": "Relativistic jets are the most energetic manifestation of the active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) phe- nomenon. AGN jets are observed from the radio through\ngamma-rays and carry copious amounts of matter and energy from the sub-parsec\ncentral regions out to the kiloparsec and often megaparsec scale galaxy and\ncluster environs. While most spatially resolved jets are seen in the radio, an\nin- creasing number have been discovered to emit in the optical/near-IR and/or\nX-ray bands. Here we discuss a spectacular example of this class, the 3C 111\njet, housed in one of the nearest, double-lobed FR II radio galaxies known. We\ndiscuss new, deep Chandra and HST observations that reveal both near-IR and\nX-ray emission from several components of the 3C 111 jet, as well as both the\nnorthern and southern hotspots. Important differences are seen between the\nmorphologies in the radio, X-ray and near-IR bands. The long (over 100 kpc on\neach side), straight nature of this jet makes it an excellent prototype for\nfuture, deep observations, as it is one of the longest such features seen in\nthe radio, near-IR/optical and X-ray bands. Several independent lines of\nevidence, including the X-ray and broadband spectral shape as well as the\nimplied velocity of the approaching hotspot, lead us to strongly disfavor the\nEC/CMB model and instead favor a two-component synchrotron model to explain the\nobserved X-ray emission for several jet components. Future observations with\nNuSTAR, HST, and Chandra will allow us to further constrain the emission\nmechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Tool support is crucial to modern software development, evolution, and maintenance. Early tools reused the static analysis performed by the compiler. These were followed by dynamic analysis tools and more recently tools that exploit natural language. This later class has the advantage that it can incorporate not only the code, but artifacts from all phases of software construction and its subsequent evolution. Unfortunately, the natural language found in source code often uses a vocabulary different from that used in other software artifacts and thus raises the vocabulary mismatch problem. This problem exists because many natural-language tools imported from Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) implicitly assume the use of a single natural language vocabulary. Vocabulary normalization, which goes well beyond simple identifier splitting, brings the vocabulary of the source into line with other artifacts. Consequently, it is expected to improve the performance of existing and future IR and NLP based tools. As a case study, an experiment with an LSI-based feature locator is replicated. Normalization universally improves performance. For the tersest queries, this improvement is over 200% (p < 0.0001).",

The folksonomies built from these tags are an interesting topic that has seen little empirical research. This study compared the search information retrieval (IR) performance of folksonomies from social bookmarking Web sites against search engines and subject directories. Thirty-four participants created 103 queries for various information needs. Results from each IR system were collected and participants judged relevance. Folksonomy search results overlapped with those from the other systems, and documents found by both search engines and folksonomies were significantly more likely to be judged relevant than those returned by any single IR system type. The search engines in the study had the highest precision and recall, but the folksonomies fared surprisingly well. Del.icio.us was statistically indistinguishable from the directories in many cases. Overall the directories were more precise than the folksonomies but they had similar recall scores. Better query handling may enhance folksonomy IR performance further. The folksonomies studied were promising, and may be able to improve Web search performance.",

        "abstract": "Silicalite-1 zeolite exhibits a characteristic pentasil framework vibration around 540\u2212550 cm\u22121. In the initial stages of zeolite synthesis, however, this band is observed at much higher wavenumbers: literature shows this vibration to depend on particle size and to shift over 100 cm\u22121 with increasing condensation. In this work, the pentasil vibration frequency was derived from theoretical molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the correct IR band assignments for important nanoparticles. The IR spectroscopic fingerprint of oligomeric five-ring containing precursors proposed in the literature was computed and compared with experimental data. Our theoretical results show that, while isolated five-membered rings show characteristic vibrational bands around 650 cm\u22121, the combination of five-membered rings in the full MFI-type structure readily generates the bathochromic shift to the typical pentasil vibration around 550 cm\u22121. As opposed to what was previously believed, the IR band does not shift gradually as nanoparticle size increases, but it is highly dependent on the specific way structural units are added. The most important feature is the appearance of an additional band when double five-membered rings are included, which allows for a clear distinction between the key stages of early zeolite nucleation. Furthermore, the combination of the simulated spectra with the experimental observation of this spectral feature in nanoparticles extracted from silicalite-1 clear solutions supports their structured nature. The theoretical insights on the dependency of pentasil vibrations with the degree of condensation offer valuable support toward future investigations on the genesis of a zeolite crystal.",

Using a prototype of our FCA-based toolset CORDIET, we converted the pdf-files containing the papers to plain text, indexed them with Lucene using a thesaurus containing terms related to FCA research and then created the concept lattice shown in this paper. We visualized, analyzed and explored the literature\r\nwith concept lattices and discovered multiple interesting research streams in IR of which we give an extensive overview.

        "abstract": "Due to the progress of density functional theory (DFT) accurate computations of vibrational spectra of isolated molecules have become a standard task in computational chemistry. This is not yet the case for solution spectra. To contribute to the exploration of corresponding computational procedures, here we suggest a more efficient variant of the so-called instantaneous normal-mode analysis (INMA). This variant applies conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are based on nonpolarizable molecular mechanics (MM) force fields, to the rapid generation of a large ensemble of different solvation shells for a solute molecule. Short hybrid simulations, in which the solute is treated by DFT and the aqueous solvent by MM, start from snapshots of the MM solute-solvent MD trajectory and yield a set of statistically independent hydration shells partially adjusted to the DFT/MM force field. Within INMA, these shells are kept fixed at their 300 K structures, line spectra are calculated from the DFT/MM Hessians of the solute, and its inhomogeneously broadened solution spectra are derived by second-order statistics. As our test application we have selected the phosphate ions HPO42- and H2PO4- because sizable solvation effects are expected for the IR spectra of these strongly polarizable ions. The widths, intensities, and spectral positions of the calculated bands are compared with experimental IR spectra recorded by us for the purpose of checking the computational procedures. These comparisons provide insights into the merits and limitations of the available DFT/MM approach to the prediction of IR spectra in the condensed phase.",

        "abstract": "We present a new measurement of the evolving galaxy far-IR luminosity\r\nfunction (LF) extending out to redshifts z~5, with resulting implications for\r\nthe level of dust-obscured star-formation density in the young Universe. To\r\nachieve this we have exploited recent advances in sub-mm/mm imaging with\r\nSCUBA-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large\r\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), which together provide unconfused\r\nimaging with sufficient dynamic range to provide meaningful coverage of the\r\nluminosity-redshift plane out to z>4. Our results support previous indications\r\nthat the faint-end slope of the far-IR LF is sufficiently flat that comoving\r\nluminosity-density is dominated by bright objects (~L*). However, we find that\r\nthe number-density/luminosity of such sources at high redshifts has been\r\nseverely over-estimated by studies that have attempted to push the\r\nhighly-confused Herschel SPIRE surveys beyond z~2. Consequently we confirm\r\nrecent reports that cosmic star-formation density is dominated by UV-visible\r\nstar formation at z>4. Using both direct (1/Vmax) and maximum likelihood\r\ndeterminations of the LF, we find that its high-redshift evolution is well\r\ncharacterized by continued positive luminosity evolution coupled with negative\r\ndensity evolution (with increasing redshift). This explains why bright sub-mm\r\nsources continue to be found at z>5, even though their integrated contribution\r\nto cosmic star-formation density at such early times is very small. The\r\nevolution of the far-IR galaxy LF thus appears similar in form to that already\r\nestablished for active galactic nuclei, possibly reflecting a similar\r\ndependence on the growth of galaxy mass.",

        "abstract": "A unified database framework that will enable better comprehension of ranked XML retrieval is still a challenge in the XML database field. We propose a logical algebra, named score region algebra, that enables transparent specification of information retrieval (IR) models for XML databases. The transparency is achieved by a possibility to instantiate various retrieval models, using abstract score functions within algebra operators, while logical query plan and operator definitions remain unchanged. Our algebra operators model three important aspects of XML retrieval: element relevance score computation, element score propagation, and element score combination. To illustrate the usefulness of our algebra we instantiate four different, well known IR scoring models, and combine them with different score propagation and combination functions. We implemented the algebra operators in a prototype system on top of a low-level database kernel. The evaluation of the system is performed on a collection of IEEE articles in XML format provided by INEX. We argue that state of the art XML IR models can be transparently implemented using our score region algebra framework on top of any low-level physical database engine or existing RDBMS, allowing a more systematic investigation of retrieval model behavior.",

These observations are combined with a compilation of CO measurements\r\nfrom the literature. From this, we infer the luminosity correction factors r2,1\r\n= 0.8 and r3,1 = 0.65 of the CO rotational levels J=2 and J=3, respectively,\r\nvalid for SFGs and sub-mm galaxies at z>1. The combined sample of CO-detected\r\nSFGs at z>1 shows a large spread in star formation efficiency (SFE), such that\r\nSFE extend beyond the low values of local spirals and overlap the distribution\r\nof z>1 sub-mm galaxies. We find that the spread in SFE (or equivalently in\r\nmolecular gas depletion timescale) is due to primarily the specific star\r\nformation rate, but also stellar mass and redshift. Correlations of SFE with\r\nthe offset from the main-sequence and the compactness of the starburst are less\r\nclear. The increase of the molecular gas depletion timescale with M* now\r\nrevealed by low M* SFGs at z>1 is opposed to the admitted constant molecular\r\ngas depletion timescale and the linear Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We confirm\r\nan increase of the molecular gas fraction (fgas) from z~0.2 to z~1.2, followed\r\nby a quasi non-evolution toward higher redshifts. At each redshift fgas shows a\r\nlarge dispersion due to the dependence of fgas on M*, producing a gradient of\r\nincreasing fgas with decreasing M*. We provide the first measure of fgas of z>1\r\nSFGs at the low-M* end (10^9.4 < M*/Msun < 10^9.9), reaching a mean fgas =\r\n0.67+/-0.20 which shows a clear fgas upturn. Finally, we find evidence for a\r\nnon-universal dust-to-gas ratio among high-redshift SFGs and sub-mm galaxies,\r\nlocal spirals and ULIRGs with near-solar metallicities.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a meta-analysis of the effects of search experience on search performance in terms of the recall measure in controlled IR user experiments. More specifically, this study was designed to answer the research question: how large is the average effect size in the set of studies included in the meta-analysis? Search experience, a manifestation of users' search skills accumulated through their interactions with IR systems over time, has been identified as an important research variable in user search behaviours. The participants included in primary studies were end-users or intermediaries recruited for IR user experiments. The results of the meta-analysis (N = 8) using a fixed-effects model showed that search experience has an overall positive effect on the recall measure (weighted mean correlation coefficient r = 0.04, 95% confidence interval was -0.01 to 0.09). Our findings may provide implications for designing adaptive or personalized IR systems that take into account the contextual information at the user and interactional levels.",

MKIDs are revolutionary\r\ncryogenic detectors, capable of detecting single photons and measuring their\r\nenergy without filters or gratings, similar to an X-ray microcalorimeter. MKIDs\r\nare nearly ideal, noiseless photon detectors, as they do not suffer from read\r\nnoise or dark current and have nearly perfect cosmic ray rejection. ARCONS is\r\nan Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) containing a lens-coupled 2024 pixel MKID\r\narray yielding a 20\"x20\" field of view, and has been deployed on the Palomar\r\n200\" and Lick 120\" telescopes for 24 nights of observing.

        "abstract": "Current configuration management systems promote workspaces that isolate developers from each other. This isolation is both good and bad. It is good, because developers make their changes without any interference from changes made concurrently by other developers. It is bad, because not knowing which artifacts are changing in parallel regularly leads to problems when changes are promoted from workspaces into a central configuration management repository. Overcoming the bad isolation, while retaining the good isolation, is a matter of raising awareness among developers, an issue traditionally ignored by the discipline of configuration management. To fill this void, we have developed Palant\u00edr, a novel workspace awareness tool that complements existing configuration management systems by providing developers with insight into other workspaces. In particular, the tool informs a developer of which other developers change which other artifacts, calculates a simple measure of severity of those changes, and graphically displays the information in a configurable and generally non-obtrusive manner. To illustrate the use of Palant\u00edr, we demonstrate how it integrates with two representative configuration management systems.",

Inspection of the filtered data showed evidence of large amplitude photon bursts arising from single molecular events in these organized media. In pure H2O containing dye, no bursts were observed. The results indicate that only molecules resident within the hydrophobic core of the micelle were detected. From the number of events observed and the number of events expected, partition coefficients (Kp) for IR-132 in SDS and triton X-100 solutions were calculated. In addition, the photon yield per molecule associated with only those molecules resident within the hydrophobic cavity of the micelle was determined.",

The MP2 calculations an carried out with different numbers of frozen core orbitals to find how the number of bromine orbitals used for electron correlation influences the predicted molecular parameters and IR spectra of the species in question. Three options were used: (a) all electrons (full), with both the core and valence orbitals considered; (b) partial frozen core option (pfc), when the orbitals up to 3p of bromine were frozen; and (c) full frozen core option (ffc), when all core orbitals up to 3d were frozen. The CCSD(T) calculations for geometric parameters were carried out with both the pfc and ffc options, while for the prediction of the IR spectra only the ffc option was used. In addition, the calculations at the DFT and MP2(pfc) levels with inclusion of f functions on carbon and bromine atoms in bromomethanes (and also the CCSD(T)(pfc) calculations for CH3Br) were carried out to predict the changes in the geometric parameters and/or vibrational IR spectra of the molecules upon inclusion of f functions The geometries of bromomethanes (particularly the CBr bond lengths) are predicted better by the DFT and CCSD(T) calculations when the f functions (in particular on bromine atom) are included, while the MP2 calculations without f functions are good enough for comet predictions of the molecular geometries. The molecular parameters and vibrational IR spectra of bromomethanes in question and their deuterated species predicted by the DFT, MP2(ffc) and CCSD(T)(ffc) with the 6-311G(2d,2p) basis set agree well with the available experimental data.",

        "abstract": "NGC 2146, a nearby luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), presents evidence for\r\noutflows along the disk minor axis in all gas phases (ionized, neutral atomic\r\nand molecular). We present an analysis of the multi-phase starburst driven\r\nsuperwind in the central 5 kpc as traced in spatially resolved spectral line\r\nobservations, using far-IR Herschel PACS spectroscopy, to probe the effects on\r\nthe atomic and ionized gas, and optical integral field spectroscopy to examine\r\nthe ionized gas through diagnostic line ratios. We observe an increased ~250\r\nkm/s velocity dispersion in the OI 63 micron, OIII 88 micron, NII 122\r\nmicron and CII 158 micron fine-structure lines that is spatially coincident\r\nwith high excitation gas above and below the disk. We model this with a slow\r\n~200 km/s shock and trace the superwind to the edge of our field of view 2.5\r\nkpc above the disk. We present new SOFIA 37 micron observations to explore the\r\nwarm dust distribution, and detect no clear dust entrainment in the outflow.\r\nThe stellar kinematics appear decoupled from the regular disk rotation seen in\r\nall gas phases, consistent with a recent merger event disrupting the system. We\r\nconsider the role of the superwind in the evolution of NGC 2146 and speculate\r\non the evolutionary future of the system. Our observations of NGC 2146 in the\r\nfar-IR allow an unobscured view of the wind, crucial for tracing the superwind\r\nto the launching region at the disk center, and provide a local analog for\r\nfuture ALMA observations of outflows in high redshift systems.",

        "abstract": "Photodetectors with ultrafast response are explored using inorganic/organic hybrid perovskites. High responsivity and fast optoelectronic response are achieved due to the exceptional semiconducting properties of perovskite materials. However, most of the perovskite-based photodetectors exploited to date are centered on Pb-based perovskites, which only afford spectral response across the visible spectrum. This study demonstrates a high-performance near-IR (NIR) photodetector using a stable low-bandgap Sn-containing perovskite, (CH3NH3)0.5(NH2CHNH2)0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 (MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.5Sn0.5I3), which is processed with an antioxidant additive, ascorbic acid (AA). The addition of AA effectively strengthens the stability of Sn-containing perovskite against oxygen, thereby significantly inhibiting the leakage current. Consequently, the derived photodetector shows high responsivity with a detectivity of over 1012 Jones ranging from 800 to 970 nm. Such low-cost, solution processable NIR photodetectors with high performance show promising potential for future optoelectronic applications.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of general audience digital libraries (GADLs) defines a context that represents a hybrid of both \"traditional\" IR, using primarily bibliographic resources provided by database vendors, and \"popular\" IR, exemplified by public search systems available on the World Wide Web. Findings of a study investigating end-user searching and response to a GADL are reported. Data collected from a Web-based end-user survey and data logs of resource usage for a Web-based GADL were analyzed for user characteristics, patterns of access and use, and user feedback. Cross-tabulations using respondent demographics revealed several key differences in how the system was used and valued by users of different age groups. Older users valued the service more than younger users and engaged in different searching and viewing behaviors. The GADL more closely resembles traditional retrieval systems in terms of content and purpose of use, but is more similar to popular IR systems in terms of user behavior and accessibility. A model that defines the dual context of the GADL environment is derived from the data analysis and existing IR models in general and other specific contexts. The authors demonstrate the distinguishing characteristics of this IR context, and discuss implications for the development and evaluation of future GADLs to accommodate a variety of user needs and expectations.",

        "abstract": "The article presents a 'revisionist' synopsis of the thinking of some important early twentieth-century 'Idealist' IR writers. I contend that these writers ground their interpretations of international relations on a shared paradigm that has hitherto gone largely unrecognised. Following a critique of certain widely held views of IR Idealism, I draw attention to a number of aspects or themes in this body of writing in an attempt to establish the underlying paradigm. I argue that the authors in question were familiar with the type of thinking that later came to be called Realist, but held that industrial modernisation rendered it increasingly anachronistic and dangerous. The crucial difference between Idealism and Realism is in their respective theories of history. In order to understand Idealist IR thinking, it is essential to realise the extent to which it relies on the notion, not so much of progress (as is usually asserted) as of an inescapable, directional historical process.",

        "abstract": "The future space missions Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA will use the Halpha emission\r\nline to measure the redshifts of tens of millions of galaxies. The Halpha\r\nluminosity function at z>0.7 is one of the major sources of uncertainty in\r\nforecasting cosmological constraints from these missions. We construct unified\r\nempirical models of the Halpha luminosity function spanning the range of\r\nredshifts and line luminosities relevant to the redshift surveys proposed with\r\nEuclid and WFIRST-AFTA. By fitting to observed luminosity functions from Halpha\r\nsurveys, we build three models for its evolution. Different fitting\r\nmethodologies, functional forms for the luminosity function, subsets of the\r\nempirical input data, and treatment of systematic errors are considered to\r\nexplore the robustness of the results. Functional forms and model parameters\r\nare provided for all three models, along with the counts and redshift\r\ndistributions up to z~2.5 for a range of limiting fluxes (F_Halpha>0.5 - 3 x\r\n10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1) that are relevant for future space missions. For\r\ninstance, in the redshift range 0.90<z<1.8, our models predict an available\r\ngalaxy density in the range 7700--13300 and 2000--4800 deg^-2 respectively at\r\nfluxes above F_Halpha>1 and 2 x 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1, and 32000--48000 for\r\nF_Halpha>0.5 x 10^-16 erg cm^-2 s^-1 in the extended redshift range 0.40<z<1.8.\r\nWe also consider the implications of our empirical models for the total Halpha\r\nluminosity density of the Universe, and the closely related cosmic star\r\nformation history.",
